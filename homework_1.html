    <h1>Homework 1: What is Statistics, and Why Can It Be Useful for Cybersecurity?</h1>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p><strong>Statistics</strong> is the branch of mathematics concerned with collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It provides tools to understand uncertainty, identify patterns, and make informed decisions based on evidence rather than assumptions.</p>

    <p>In the modern digital world, vast amounts of information are generated every second — from system logs and network packets to user behavior data. <strong>Cybersecurity</strong>, which focuses on protecting information systems from attacks, heavily relies on statistical methods to detect and respond to threats hidden within this data.</p>

    <h2>2. The Role of Statistics</h2>
    <p>At its core, statistics helps to <em>transform raw data into insight</em>. Key statistical tasks include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Descriptive analysis</strong> — summarizing data using averages, distributions, and trends.</li>
      <li><strong>Inferential analysis</strong> — drawing conclusions from limited samples.</li>
      <li><strong>Predictive modeling</strong> — estimating future events based on historical patterns.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These tasks are directly applicable to cybersecurity, where analysts must understand what “normal” activity looks like and recognize when anomalies may indicate attacks or system breaches.</p>

    <h2>3. Applications in Cybersecurity</h2>

    <h3>a. Anomaly Detection</h3>
    <p>Statistical models can define baseline network behavior (e.g., average login times, data transfer rates) and flag deviations.  
    <em>Example:</em> If a user typically downloads 50 MB per day but suddenly downloads 5 GB, statistical thresholds can trigger an alert.</p>

    <h3>b. Malware Analysis</h3>
    <p>Statistics are used to profile and classify malicious code based on features such as instruction frequency or file size distributions.</p>

    <h3>c. Incident Response & Forensics</h3>
    <p>Analysts use statistical summaries to reconstruct timelines and quantify the scale of an incident — for example, identifying which systems were most frequently targeted.</p>

    <h3>d. Risk Assessment</h3>
    <p>Probabilistic models help organizations estimate the likelihood and potential impact of specific attack types, guiding investment in security measures.</p>

    <h3>e. User Behavior Analytics (UBA)</h3>
    <p>By applying statistical clustering and regression, systems can distinguish between normal and suspicious user activity — improving insider-threat detection.</p>

    <h2>4. Advantages of Using Statistics in Cybersecurity</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Early detection of attacks through data-driven anomaly monitoring.</li>
      <li>Reduction of false positives by refining alert thresholds.</li>
      <li>Better decision-making through quantifiable risk assessments.</li>
      <li>Scalability, since statistical techniques can handle massive datasets produced by large networks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Statistics provides cybersecurity professionals with a <strong>quantitative foundation for decision-making</strong>. It enables them to uncover hidden patterns, predict threats, and respond efficiently. In a field where attackers constantly adapt, <strong>statistical thinking turns raw data into actionable defense</strong> — making it one of the most powerful tools in modern digital security.</p>
