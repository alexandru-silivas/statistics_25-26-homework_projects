      <h2>What is Statistics, and Why Can It Be Useful for Cybersecurity?</h2>

      <p><strong>Statistics</strong> is the discipline that involves collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to discover patterns and make informed decisions. It allows researchers and professionals to transform raw data into meaningful insights, often using probabilistic models and quantitative reasoning to describe uncertainty and trends.</p>

      <p>In the context of <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, statistics plays a vital role in both proactive and reactive defense strategies. By analyzing vast quantities of data — such as network logs, traffic patterns, and user behavior — statistical methods help identify anomalies that may indicate malicious activity or system vulnerabilities.</p>

      <p>For instance, <em>anomaly detection</em> techniques rely heavily on statistical modeling to recognize deviations from normal network activity, while <em>predictive analytics</em> can estimate the likelihood of future attacks based on historical data. Moreover, statistical tools are essential in risk assessment, intrusion detection, and threat intelligence systems, helping cybersecurity experts make evidence-based decisions.</p>

      <p>Ultimately, statistics provides a quantitative foundation for cybersecurity — transforming scattered data points into actionable intelligence and enabling continuous improvement of defense mechanisms in an ever-evolving threat landscape.</p>
