      <h2>What is Statistics, and why is it important for Cybersecurity?</h2>

      <h3>1. Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        In today’s data-driven world, information has become one of the most powerful resources available.
        The ability to analyze large volumes of raw data and extract valuable insights underpins progress in nearly every field,
        including technology, science, and digital security. Statistics provides the tools to interpret data systematically
        and turn it into usable knowledge. This paper explains the foundations of statistics and why it is essential for cybersecurity.
      </p>

      <h3>2. What Is Statistics?</h3>
      <p>
        Statistics is the branch of mathematics focused on collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data to inform decisions.
        It helps identify patterns, relationships, and uncertainty. The two main branches are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Descriptive statistics</strong> — summarizes data (means, medians, ranges, dispersion).</li>
        <li><strong>Inferential statistics</strong> — draws conclusions about populations from samples (hypothesis testing, regression, intervals).</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>3. The Scientific Method and the Role of Statistics</h3>
      <p>
        The scientific method (observation → hypothesis → experiment → analysis) relies on statistics to measure uncertainty, test hypotheses,
        and ensure results are reproducible. Statistics separates genuine effects from random noise and provides the quantitative basis for reliable conclusions.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Why Statistics Matters in Cybersecurity</h3>
      <p>
        Cybersecurity depends on data: network logs, access records, user behavior and more. Statistics converts these raw streams into insights that detect,
        predict, and mitigate threats.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Data analysis:</strong> reveals trends and abnormal patterns in large datasets.</li>
        <li><strong>Anomaly detection:</strong> models “normal” behavior and flags deviations suggesting attacks.</li>
        <li><strong>Threat intelligence:</strong> links indicators to build a fuller picture of risks.</li>
        <li><strong>Predictive analytics:</strong> forecasts likely attack patterns from historical data.</li>
        <li><strong>Risk assessment:</strong> quantifies likelihood and impact to prioritize defenses.</li>
        <li><strong>Incident response:</strong> helps verify and classify breaches with statistical evidence.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In short, statistics transforms noisy security data into actionable intelligence — enabling smarter, data-driven defenses and continuous improvement as threats evolve.
