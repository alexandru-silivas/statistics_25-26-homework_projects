    <h2>What is Statistics, and Why Can It Be Useful for Cybersecurity?</h2>
    <p><strong>Course:</strong> Statistics — Sapienza University of Rome | Alexandru Silivas | 2025/2026</p>

    <p><strong>Statistics</strong> is the branch of mathematics concerned with collecting, organizing, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It provides the tools necessary to understand variability in data, draw conclusions, and make informed decisions based on evidence rather than assumptions.</p>

    <p>In the context of <strong>cybersecurity</strong>, statistics plays a vital role in detecting patterns, identifying anomalies, and modeling threats. By applying statistical methods, security analysts can quantify risk, measure the likelihood of cyberattacks, and recognize deviations in network traffic that could indicate malicious activity.</p>

    <p>For example, statistical anomaly detection can help identify unusual login patterns, data transfer spikes, or access attempts from unexpected geographical locations. These models often rely on understanding the <em>distribution</em> of normal behavior — when a new data point falls far outside that distribution, it may signal a security issue.</p>

    <p>Furthermore, data-driven cybersecurity benefits from predictive modeling: using statistical regression or probabilistic inference, analysts can estimate the likelihood of future attacks based on past incidents. As cyber threats evolve, statistical thinking enables continuous learning and model updating.</p>

    <p>In summary, statistics provides the mathematical foundation for modern cybersecurity analytics — helping professionals transform raw security data into actionable insights and proactive defenses.</p>
