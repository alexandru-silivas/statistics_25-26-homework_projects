  <h1>Homework 8</h1>
  <hr class="section-separator">

  <h2>Bernoulli Processes, Random Walks, Pascal's Triangle, and Combinatorics</h2>

  <p>
    This homework compares the Bernoulli process studied in <strong>Homework 4</strong>
    and the random-walk simulations of <strong>Homework 7</strong>, showing how both are
    manifestations of the same underlying mathematical structure: the
    <strong>binomial distribution</strong> and its combinatorial foundations.
  </p>

  <!-- SECTION 1 -->
  <h3>1. Bernoulli Processes vs Random Walks</h3>

  <p>
    A <strong>Bernoulli process</strong> is a sequence of independent trials, each producing
    either a success (1) with probability <em>p</em> or a failure (0) with probability 
    <em>1 − p</em>. In <strong>Homework 4</strong>, we observed how the
    <strong>relative frequency of successes converges to p</strong> as the number of trials
    grows — a direct demonstration of the Law of Large Numbers.
  </p>

  <p>
    A <strong>random walk</strong>, as introduced in <strong>Homework 7</strong>, is obtained
    by mapping each Bernoulli trial to a step: +1 for success and −1 for failure.
    The cumulative sum of steps produces a trajectory over time.
  </p>

  <p>
    What appears to be two different processes is actually the same object viewed
    from two perspectives:  
    <strong>Bernoulli → counts; Random walk → cumulative signed displacement.</strong>
  </p>

  <div class="info-box">
    <strong>Bernoulli:</strong> K successes after n trials  
    <br>
    <strong>Random walk:</strong> Final position S = #successes − #failures = 2K − n
  </div>

  <p>
    This connection means that the <strong>distribution of final random-walk scores</strong>
    is completely determined by the <strong>binomial distribution</strong>, which in turn
    is determined by <strong>binomial coefficients</strong>.
  </p>

  <!-- SECTION 2 -->
  <h3>2. Pascal’s Triangle (Tartaglia) & Binomial Coefficients</h3>

  <p>
    Pascal’s triangle is a triangular array of <strong>binomial coefficients</strong>.
    Each entry represents the number of ways to choose <em>k</em> successes in <em>n</em> trials:
  </p>

  <p class="math-center"><strong>C(n, k) = n! / (k!(n − k)!)</strong></p>

  <p>
    Each row of the triangle represents the coefficients of the binomial expansion:
  </p>

  <p class="math-center"><strong>(p + (1 − p))ⁿ = Σ C(n, k) pᵏ (1 − p)ⁿ⁻ᵏ</strong></p>

  <p>
    These coefficients count the number of possible sequences with exactly
    <em>k</em> successes — the building blocks of both
    <strong>Bernoulli-process frequencies</strong> and
    <strong>random-walk final-score distributions</strong>.
  </p>

  <h4>Interactive Tartaglia Triangle</h4>

  <label for="ptRows">Rows:</label>
  <input id="ptRows" type="number" value="10" min="3" max="25"
         oninput="renderPascal()">

  <div id="pascalContainer">
       style="padding:10px; background:rgba(255,255,255,0.02); border-radius:8px; margin-top:15px;">
  </div>

  <p>
    Below the triangle, the page also shows <strong>Fibonacci diagonal sums</strong>,
    revealing a classical combinatorial connection: summing along “shallow diagonals”
    of Pascal’s triangle yields Fibonacci numbers.
  </p>


  <!-- SECTION 3 -->
  <h3>3. Deep Analogy Between Homework 4 & Homework 7</h3>

  <p>
    The Law of Large Numbers from HW4 and the random-walk simulations from HW7 are
    two faces of the same coin.
  </p>

  <h4>Bernoulli → LLN (Homework 4)</h4>
  <p>
    In HW4, repeated Bernoulli trials showed:
  </p>
  <p class="math-center"><strong>frequency → probability</strong></p>
  <p>
    As the number of trials grows, randomness “smooths out” and outcomes stabilize.
  </p>

  <h4>Bernoulli → Random Walk (Homework 7)</h4>
  <p>
    In HW7, the same trials were interpreted as +1 or −1 steps.  
    Instead of frequency convergence, we studied:
  </p>
  <p class="math-center"><strong>distribution of final scores</strong></p>

  <p>
    The “bell-shaped” histograms in HW7 were simply the <strong>binomial distribution
    expressed in walk coordinates</strong>.
  </p>

  <h4>How Pascal Ties Them Together</h4>

  <ul>
    <li>Pascal’s triangle counts paths in the random walk.</li>
    <li>These counts determine the binomial distribution.</li>
    <li>The LLN describes convergence to the same distribution.</li>
    <li>The binomial expansion algebraically encodes the whole process.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    Even Fibonacci appears because its diagonals count restricted classes of walk paths.
  </p>

  <div class="info-box">
    <strong>Conclusion:</strong>  
    HW4 (LLN) describes the <em>frequency</em> behavior of Bernoulli trials.  
    HW7 (random walk) describes the <em>combinatorial</em> behavior.  
    Pascal’s triangle is the <em>bridge</em> between the two.
