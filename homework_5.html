      <h2>Measures of Location and Dispersion</h2>

      <p>
        In statistics, the term <strong>measure of location</strong> (or central tendency)
        describes a value that represents the center or typical value of a dataset.
        These measures summarize where the majority of values are concentrated,
        allowing us to get a sense of the “average” behavior of the data.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Common Measures of Location</h3>
      <p>
        There are several ways to define what the "center" of a dataset is, each
        suited to different situations. Below are the most commonly used ones:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Arithmetic Mean:</strong> The simple average of all values. It is
          calculated as the sum of all data points divided by their number:
          <br><em>mean = (x₁ + x₂ + ... + xₙ) / n</em>
          <p>It is very sensitive to outliers but widely used when data is normally distributed.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Median:</strong> The middle value when data is ordered. If the number
          of data points is even, the median is the average of the two middle values.
          <p>The median is robust to outliers and is preferred when the dataset is skewed.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The most frequently occurring value in a dataset.
          <p>It’s useful for categorical data or when we want to identify the most common observation.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Geometric Mean:</strong> The nth root of the product of n values.
          <br><em>G = (x₁ × x₂ × ... × xₙ)^(1/n)</em>
          <p>Used primarily for rates of growth or ratios (e.g., in finance or population studies).</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Harmonic Mean:</strong> The reciprocal of the arithmetic mean of reciprocals:
          <br><em>H = n / (1/x₁ + 1/x₂ + ... + 1/xₙ)</em>
          <p>Useful when averaging quantities like speed or density, where each observation has equal weight in time or space.</p>
        </li>

        <li><strong>Trimmed Mean:</strong> The mean calculated after removing a certain percentage
          of the smallest and largest values.
          <p>It combines robustness (like the median) with stability (like the mean), ideal for datasets with limited outliers.</p>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2. Mean vs Variance — Location vs Dispersion</h3>
      <p>
        While the <strong>mean</strong> (or any measure of location) tells us where the data tends to cluster,
        it does not tell us how <em>spread out</em> the data is. This is where the
        <strong>variance</strong> comes in — it quantifies the amount of variability or dispersion in the dataset.
      </p>

      <p>
        Formally, the variance of a dataset measures how far each observation deviates
        from the mean, on average. If we denote the mean as <em>μ</em>, the variance is:
        <br><em>Var(X) = (1/n) × Σ(xᵢ − μ)²</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The higher the variance, the more dispersed the values are around the mean.
        The square root of the variance, called the <strong>standard deviation</strong>,
        is in the same unit as the original data, making it easier to interpret.
      </p>

      <h4>Why We Need Both</h4>
      <p>
        The mean alone can be misleading — two datasets can have the same mean
        but very different variances. For example, consider:
      </p>

      <pre><code>Dataset A: [10, 10, 10, 10, 10]   → mean = 10, variance = 0
Dataset B: [5, 15, 5, 15, 5]       → mean = 10, variance > 0</code></pre>

      <p>
        Both have the same mean (10), but Dataset B has much more variation.
        This is why we often use <strong>both measures together</strong>:
        the mean describes where data lies, while the variance tells us how tightly or loosely
        it’s grouped around that center.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Example Code: Calculating Mean and Variance</h3>
      <p>The following JavaScript example shows how to compute both values from a dataset:</p>

      <pre><code class="language-js">
// Example dataset
const data = [5, 8, 10, 7, 12];

// Arithmetic mean
const mean = data.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0) / data.length;

// Variance
const variance = data.reduce((sum, x) => sum + (x - mean) ** 2, 0) / data.length;

console.log("Mean:", mean);
console.log("Variance:", variance);
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        This simple example shows how the mean represents the data’s center,
        while the variance captures its spread. Both are essential for
        understanding data behavior in fields such as finance, cybersecurity,
        machine learning, and engineering.
