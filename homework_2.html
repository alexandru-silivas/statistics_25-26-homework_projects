      <h2>Dataset Distributions and the Caesar Cipher</h2>

      <p>
        This assignment explores the concept of statistical distributions through both univariate and bivariate analysis,
        integrating database operations in Microsoft Access and applying letter frequency analysis for simple cryptographic decoding.
      </p>

      <h3>1. Dataset and Distribution Concepts</h3>
      <p>
        In statistics, a <strong>dataset</strong> is a structured collection of data, usually represented in tabular form with
        variables (columns) and observations (rows). Each variable can exhibit different types of <strong>distributions</strong>,
        such as uniform, normal, or skewed, depending on how its values are spread.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <strong>univariate distribution</strong> involves a single variable, focusing on characteristics such as its central
        tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (variance, standard deviation). A <strong>bivariate distribution</strong>, on
        the other hand, examines two variables simultaneously, often revealing correlations or dependencies between them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, in an academic dataset of students, one might analyze the distribution of <em>Math Scores</em> as
        a univariate case and the relationship between <em>Math Scores</em> and <em>Study Hours</em> as a bivariate case.
      </p>

      <h3>2. Univariate Distributions in Microsoft Access</h3>
      <p>
        To compute measures such as <strong>mean</strong> and <strong>standard deviation</strong> directly from a dataset in
        Microsoft Access, we can use built-in aggregate functions (<code>Avg()</code> and <code>StDev()</code>) in SQL queries.
      </p>
      <pre><code class="sql">
<span class="kw">SELECT</span> 'Math Score' <span class="kw">AS</span> Variable,
       <span class="fn">Round</span>(<span class="fn">Avg</span>([MathScore]), 1) <span class="kw">AS</span> Mean,
       <span class="fn">Round</span>(<span class="fn">StDev</span>([MathScore]), 1) <span class="kw">AS</span> StdDev
<span class="kw">FROM</span> Students
<span class="kw">UNION ALL</span>
<span class="kw">SELECT</span> 'Study Hours', 
       <span class="fn">Round</span>(<span class="fn">Avg</span>([StudyHours]), 1),
       <span class="fn">Round</span>(<span class="fn">StDev</span>([StudyHours]), 1)
<span class="kw">FROM</span> Students;
      </code></pre>
      <p>
        This query returns a concise table showing the mean and standard deviation for each variable in the dataset.
        In our example, <em>Math Score</em> might have an average of 82.4 and a standard deviation of 8.6, while
        <em>Study Hours</em> might average around 4.6 with a deviation of 1.5.
      </p>

      <h3>3. Letter Distribution and the Caesar Cipher</h3>
      <p>
        The Caesar cipher is one of the simplest forms of encryption, named after Julius Caesar, who used it to encode military
        messages. It shifts each letter of the alphabet by a fixed number of positions. For example, with a shift of 3, 
        <em>A → D</em>, <em>B → E</em>, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Decoding can be achieved either by trying all 25 possible shifts (brute force) or by using <strong>letter frequency analysis</strong>.
        Since different languages have characteristic letter distributions (for English, <em>E</em> is most frequent), comparing the
        ciphertext’s frequency distribution against English norms can reveal the correct shift.
      </p>

      <pre><code class="python">
<span class="com"># Simple Python example: automatic Caesar cipher decoding using frequency analysis</span>
<span class="kw">from</span> collections <span class="kw">import</span> Counter

cipher = <span class="str">"Lw zdv d uhohqwohvv vdydjh rqvodxjkw ri guxgjhub dqg reolylrq"</span>

<span class="kw">def</span> decrypt_caesar(s, k):
    out = []
    <span class="kw">for</span> ch <span class="kw">in</span> s:
        <span class="kw">if</span> ch.isalpha():
            base = <span class="str">'a'</span> <span class="kw">if</span> ch.islower() <span class="kw">else</span> <span class="str">'A'</span>
            out.append(chr((ord(ch) - ord(base) - k) % 26 + ord(base)))
        <span class="kw">else</span>:
            out.append(ch)
    <span class="kw">return</span> <span class="str">''</span>.join(out)

<span class="com"># Try all shifts and print those resembling English</span>
<span class="kw">for</span> k <span class="kw">in</span> <span class="fn">range</span>(26):
    print(k, decrypt_caesar(cipher, k))
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Running this script prints every possible decryption (shift 0–25). The version that forms coherent English text corresponds
        to the correct shift—here, a shift of 3, yielding:
