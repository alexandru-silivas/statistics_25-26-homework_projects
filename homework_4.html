      <h2>Assignment 1 — The Meaning of “Converge”</h2>

      <p>
        In probability theory, when we say that “the frequency converges to the probability,” 
        we mean that as the number of trials of a random experiment increases, the <em>observed 
        frequency</em> of an outcome approaches its <em>theoretical probability</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, if we repeatedly toss a fair coin, we expect that about half of the outcomes 
        will be heads. In the short term, this ratio might fluctuate (e.g., 3 heads in 5 tosses, 
        or 47 heads in 100 tosses), but as the number of tosses grows, the relative frequency of 
        heads will get closer and closer to 0.5 — it <strong>converges</strong> to the true probability.
      </p>

      <section id="coin-section">
        <h3>Coin Toss Simulation</h3>
        <p>
          The graph below simulates repeated coin tosses. Notice how the observed frequency 
          (blue line) gradually stabilizes around 0.5 (the red dashed line) as the number of tosses increases.

      <h2>Assignment 2 — The Law of Large Numbers</h2>
      <p>
        The <strong>Law of Large Numbers (LLN)</strong> formalizes this concept mathematically. 
        It states that as the number of independent trials increases, the sample mean of observed 
        outcomes approaches the expected value. In other words, randomness “averages out” over 
        time, and results become more stable and predictable.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two main forms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Weak Law:</strong> The probability that the sample mean deviates significantly 
        from the expected value becomes smaller as the sample size increases.</li>
        <li><strong>Strong Law:</strong> The sample mean actually converges to the expected value 
        with probability 1 as the sample size approaches infinity.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        This concept explains why empirical frequencies can be used to estimate true probabilities, 
        and why statistical averages become more reliable with larger datasets — a cornerstone 
        of data science, signal processing, and cybersecurity analytics.

          The chart below simulates rolling a fair six-sided die multiple times. 
          The green line represents the running average of observed rolls, which 
          converges toward the expected value of <strong>3.5</strong> as the number of trials increases.

        <p>
          This simulation illustrates the same law, but using continuous random values between 0 and 1. 
          As the number of samples increases, the running average approaches 0.5, showing that even in 
          continuous probability spaces, empirical averages converge toward the expected mean.

          This simulation shows the Law of Large Numbers using coin tosses again. As the number of tosses grows, 
          the estimated probability of “heads” stabilizes around 0.5 — an empirical demonstration that frequencies 
          <strong>converge to the true probability</strong>.
